            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p1> 
                My name is parbesh Rasaily I was raised and I grew up in a camp, living there until I was 14. It was a rough environment, stones, dust and filth were all I had to play with.
                I adapted to this life. I was completely ignorant of the outside world, even my family’s life in Bhutan from before I was born. We lived in Nepal for 14 years, but we didn't 
                have a single opportunity for work or legal papers. The IOM (International Organization of Migration) proposed a third country settlement in 2007. In the beginning, 90% of 
                the people refused the proposal. Eventually, the more educated people in the camp began to advise people to accept the third country settlement. The refugees divided into 
                two groups, the tension turned into arguments, and the violence started. The United States agreed to take some of the refugees.On July 13, 2010, we arrived in Columbus with 
                my family. When I arrived at Columbus airport I was surprised by the sheer number of people. All of them in a rush and all the tall buildings. There were people from the  
                World Relife refugees waiting for us and they took me to our apartment. I went to Northland High school and graduate 2015 and I started working at kroger as assistan manager. 
                I enjoy time playing guitar and drum as well as spending time with my friends and family.I always love doing coding and solving problems  I have always wanted to work with  
                computers and I work wilt few software and computers problem at my work I'm passionate about learning new tools and applying what I learn back into my work and that is why
                I have joined We Can Code It boot camp.
